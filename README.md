📁 Projects Repository

Welcome to my projects repository. This space acts as a structured collection of the software projects I develop whilst studying programming and improving my technical skills. Each folder represents an individual project, created with the aim of practising, experimenting, and deepening my understanding of different technologies.

Although many of these applications began as learning exercises, they reflect my progress across various areas of software development, including:

Frontend development (React, React Native, TypeScript)

Backend foundations

Algorithmic thinking

User interface design

Practical problem-solving through code

My intention is to maintain this repository as a long-term archive of my learning journey. Over time, the collection will continue to grow, documenting both earlier experiments and more mature projects as my skills develop.

If you are exploring this repository, I hope it provides an insight into my dedication to learning and my enthusiasm for building software.
